Within hulls, humans can be protected from the water pressure. There isn't a need to find diving suit if it's not too deep. But the cold water won't spare anyone who doesn't belong to this planet.
Talents and genes are removed. The only talent for the survival here is you.


[h1]In Door Combat[/h1]

In Die Hard, one second is enough to determine the difference between life and death. Small arm rounds are equally lethal as they are back on the Earth. It is enough to kill a human being with just one shot in the head. Shot to the torso can also put the victim into a dire situation. Always shoot before your enemy does. Always wear protection gear before going into a gunfight.

There are many different guns that you can acquire. They have different attribute. Armor vest can fully stop a bullet if the bullet doesn't penetrate it. [u]Note that most bullets won't travel far in the water. Use specialized weapon when submerged.[/u]

[h1]Naval Combat[/h1]

All submarines have been adjusted their hull strength to 600. It may sounds a lot but the level terrains are different. In many cases, once the submarine drops, it drops into the abyss. There won't be a platform to catch. No encounter-hull breach-sitting on the sea floor-kill everything-getting up loop. Fix the sub before the water pressure crushes it. Or better, don't let the water flood in in the first place.

There are more devices that can go broken on your sub: lamps, vents, even turrets. Hammerheads will knock down turret first. Others may also have a interest into them.


While coil guns and chain guns are very effective against organic targets. They are less effective against personnel in hulls in submarine warfare, unless some fools try to board the ship openly. But you can still wash the deck by blind shooting the possible areas. EMP shells can black out sturdy targets that are normally hard to break. Armour Piecing Incendiary Shell can go through one layer of hull and violently burns inside. Acid Shell is good for burning through multiple layers of hull given time.

All submarines are modded to suit this mod. They are tougher and equipped with upgrade slots. You can now fully custom your submarine as you wish in the upgrade store. You can buy new engine and replace the old one. You can change supply cabinet into a weapon holder. But be noted that each submarine has a modifying limits. The navigation Terminal needs a transducer to work.

The reactor can explode if it reaches a critical condition. The common cause is it works in the water too long. Water may squeeze into it and damage the control device, causing it to go over heat. Turn off the reactor before everything is too late. A logbook in the reactor room should guide you better.

[h1]Vertical Thrusters[/h1]

Die Hard introduces you the vertical force on submarine. Buying vertical thrusters will allow your submarine to move vertically in a situation that demands urgent buoyancy. These thrusters are heavy-power consumers. It's recommended not to use your main engine and thrusters in the same time, unless you have a very powerful reactor or backup battery grid.

[h1]Destroyable Items[/h1]

Don't like the face of the outpost manager? Beside than killing him, you can totally trash his outpost. Many things in the outposts now react with bullets. Lamps, monitors, chair, vent, fire extinguisher holders, you name it.

Thanks to the evilfactory's code. The outposts now can have real enterable doors. This unlocks many new outpost building methods. You can enjoy a fully functioned outpost with individual dorm room and reactor complex...
